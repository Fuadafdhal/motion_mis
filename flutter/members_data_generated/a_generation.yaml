- about: I really love playing video games since childhood. I finally decided to not
    only enjoy it, but also want to make it. This story was what motivated me to learn
    the secrets of making games, which turned out to be both fun and challenging.
    My interest in games has also taken me further into the world of software development.
    Currently, this ability is what finally pushed me to pursue digital product development
    skills as an improvement over my skill set in the field of IT.
